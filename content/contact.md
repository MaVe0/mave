This page is primarily intended to further develop my knowledge in the areas of web server configuration, data visualisation and programming of R Shiny applications. The data presented here are mostly freely available on the internet and can refer to various topics and areas: Besides my professional engagement in educational research, I am interested in natural sciences, technology, video games and music. Updates are probably made at very irregular intervals. Since I expect very few visitors, I have deliberately not added a comment function. If you are here because of very specific searches and have questions about content or code, feel free to contact me by [email](mailto: mv@tinoo.ch) or browse my [GitHub repos](https://github.com/MaVe0/mave).
